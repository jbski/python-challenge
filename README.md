# Python-challenge
The Python Challenge includes four Python scripts that analyze data sets based on a combination of .csv and .txt files.  The Python scripts analyze the data sets and display the   output to the terminal and write the same output to a .csv or .txt file.

## PyBank
The PyBank script analyzes the financial records of a company based on a .csv file consisting of "Date" and "Profit/Losses" columns.

## PyPoll
The PyBank script analyzes poll data in a .csv file and answers a series of questions based on the voting records.

## Extra Content:
## PyBoss
The PyBoss script takes a set of employee data and reformats it based on a new set of requirements.  

## PyParagraph
The PyParagraph script takes a paragraph of writen text data and provides an analysis including the total words, total sentences, and related stats.
